# ft_irc

An Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server implementation project developed as part of the 42 school curriculum. This project aims to create a functional IRC server that follows the IRC protocol, enhancing understanding of network programming, socket communication, and server-client architecture.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Panesico/ft_irc.git
cd ft_irc
make
```

## Usage

To run the IRC server:

```bash
./ircserv <port> <password>
```

Where:
- `<port>` is the port number on which your IRC server will listen for incoming connections
- `<password>` is the connection password

## Features

- TCP socket programming
- Client-server communication
- Multiple client handling
- Channel management
- User authentication
- Message routing between clients and channels
- Implementation of IRC commands

Bonus features (if implemented):
- File transfer
- Bot integration

## IRC Commands

### General Commands

- **NICK**: Set or change nickname
- **USER**: Set username, hostname, and realname
- **JOIN**: Join a channel
- **MSG**: Send a private message to a user or channel
- **QUIT**: Disconnect from the server

### Channel Operator Commands

- **KICK**: Eject a client from the channel
- **INVITE**: Invite a client to a channel
- **TOPIC**: Change or view the channel topic
- **MODE**: Change the channelâ€™s mode
  - **i**: Set/remove Invite-only channel
  - **t**: Set/remove the restrictions of the TOPIC command to channel operators
  - **k**: Set/remove the channel key (password)
  - **o**: Give/take channel operator privilege
  - **l**: Set/remove the user limit to the channel


Usage examples:

```
/NICK newNickname
/JOIN #channel
/PRIVMSG #channel :Hello, everyone!
/PART #channel
/QUIT :Goodbye!
```

## Program Flow

Here's a high-level overview of how the program should flow:

1. Server Initialization
   - Create and bind socket
   - Set socket to non-blocking mode
   - Start listening for connections

2. Main Event Loop
   - Use select() or poll() for non-blocking I/O
   - Accept new client connections
   - Receive data from existing clients
   - Parse received messages
   - Route messages to appropriate command handlers
   - Send responses back to clients

3. Command Handling
   - Process specific IRC commands
   - Update server state (e.g., user information, channel memberships)
   - Generate and send appropriate responses

4. Client Disconnection
   - Handle client disconnections (voluntary or due to errors)
   - Clean up resources associated with disconnected clients

5. Server Shutdown
   - Close all client connections
   - Free allocated resources
   - Close server socket

## Module Division and TODO List

The project is divided into three main modules, each with its own set of tasks:

### 1. Network and Client Management Module

   - [ ] Implement socket creation and binding
   - [ ] Set up listening for incoming connections
   - [ ] Set up non-blocking I/O using select() or poll()
   - [ ] Implement basic error handling and logging for network operations

- **Client Management**
   - [ ] Implement client data structure
   - [ ] Handle client connections (accept new clients)
   - [ ] Manage client connections and disconnections
   - [ ] Handle multiple clients concurrently
   - [ ] Implement the main event loop

### 2. Message Parsing and Command Handling Module

- **Message Parsing**
   - [ ] Implement IRC protocol message parser
   - [ ] Route messages to appropriate handlers

- **Command Handling**
   - [ ] Implement NICK command

   - [ ] Implement TOPIC command
   - [ ] Implement LIST command
   - [ ] Implement NAMES command
   - [ ] Generate and format server responses
   - [ ] Implement error handling for invalid commands or parameters

### 3. Channel and Server State Management Module

- **Channel Management**

   - [ ] Manage channel user lists

- **Server State Management**
   - [ ] Implement server-wide state management (users, channels, etc.)
   - [ ] Handle client authentication
   - [ ] Manage client nickname and username changes
   - [ ] Integrate networking module for sending responses
   - [ ] Integrate command handling module for executing commands
